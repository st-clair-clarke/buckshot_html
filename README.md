### Buckshot [buhk-shot] *noun* When darts land wildly all over the board. ###

Buckshot HTML is, you guessed it, the HTML platform built on top of the Buckshot
application framework.

## Status: Alpha ##
Project is currently in the **alpha** stage of development.  It will likely not
move to beta or v1.0 until after Dart ships v1.0. This is to ensure that that 
library is working correctly with the Dart APIs, which are still in flux.

## For Modern Web Browsers ##
While the HTML platform may attempt some compatibility with older/non-compliant 
browsers, the target focus is centered squarely on **modern** web browsers.  If Buckshot HTML
isn't working in your browser of choice, then it isn't modern.  Ok that may be a 
bit harsh, but seriously: Use Chrome.

## Getting Started ##
See the "getting_started" document in the doc/ folder.

## Features ##
<table>
<tr>
<td>Template-Driven</td>
<td>Similar to Xaml, but more simplified and flexible.  Supports XML, JSON, and YAML formats.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Actions</td>
<td>Event-driven actions, like playing animations, changing properties, etc, in XML templates instead of code (you can also do it in code too, if desired)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Controls</td>
<td>Dozens of controls included with the HTML library, everything from primitive containers to complex template-supporting controls, like ListBox and TreeView</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data Binding</td>
<td>
Buckshot supports 4 different types of binding from XML templates (or in code):  Resource binding, element-to-element binding, data binding, and template binding</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Events</td>
<td>.net folks will find this model to be very familiar.  We use it to wrap DOM events and for other internal events, but you can use it in your own apps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Style Templates</td>
<td>Use a common style library among multiple elements.  Individual changes to style property values will automatically update any elements using that style</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extensibility</td>
<td>Everything in Buckshot is designed to be extensible, so you can create libraries of your own controls, resources, and more</td>
</tr>
</table>
